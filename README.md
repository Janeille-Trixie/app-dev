### Below are my recommended 🥇 *Animated Fantasy Movie* and *Sci-fi series*:  

- **Frozen** ❄️: I've loved Frozen since I was a kid, and even now, watching clips still makes my inner child happy 💙. The story was magical, combining magic with deep values, and showing that love and family 💌👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 are at the heart of everything. **Olaf⛄** is my favorite character, he never failed to make me laugh because he has this hilarious way of making the smallest things feel big and exciting.
  
- **The 100** 🌏: I watched The 100 during the pandemic, staying at home 🛌 and just binge-watching 📺. Every episode had its own way of capturing my attention, always making me eager to watch the next one. It’s set in a world after a disaster, where a group of survivors must deal with dangerous challenges and fight for survival 🔥. The show has intense battles, strong friendships, and surprising twists. It really shows what it means to be human, especially when facing impossible situations.
